Web 3.0 (Web3) is the third generation of the evolution of web technologies. The web, also known as the World Wide Web, is the foundational layer for how the internet is used, providing website and application services.

Web3 is the third generation of the internet currently being built, where websites and apps will be able to process information in a smart human-like way through technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Big Data, decentralized ledger technology (DLT), and more.

Web 3.0 is still evolving and being defined, and as such, there isn't a canonical, universally accepted definition. Web 3.0 will have a strong emphasis on decentralized applications and make extensive use of blockchain-based technologies. Web 3.0 will also make use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to help empower more intelligent and adaptive applications.

## Key Features of Web3:

- Ubiquity
- Semantic Web
- Artificial Intelligence
- Spatial Web and 3D Graphics
- Decentralization through blockchain

## What is the difference between Web2 & Web3?
Web2 aims to connect people, Web3 combines this data in meaning along with increasing trust.
